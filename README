Target directory (tdir) structure:
tdir/site/
tdir/site/complex.prmtop
tdir/site/complex.inpcrd
tdir/site/complex.pdb
tdir/water/
tdir/water/ligwat.prmtop
tdir/water/ligwat.inpcrd
tdir/water/ligwat.pdb


analysis/
Contains file to calculate ddG from completed runs. Both .sh and .py files should be in tdir/.. location

site/
Contains file structure and input files for running MD for the protein-ligand complex

water/
Contains file structure and input files for running MD for the solvated ligand

old/
Old scripts, could be useful later on.




First step: ./setup.sh tdir*
setup_*.sh makes copies... maybe add functionality to setup.sh?

Second step: ./run_rel_otf.sh tdir*
make sure all pointers in run_rel_otf.sh are to the correct location... maybe allow the user to do this automatically or via the command?
Command currently moves the directory as the final step. Probably disable this for testing, maybe add functionality for where to place it from the command line?

Third step: ./analysis.sh tdir*
Compiles ddGs and dumps them into rel_summary_seed.dat

Python Files:
site_water_equal_1.py: Overhead script for setting up calculations. Includes options to pass to other scripts
site_water_equal_1_special.py: Same as above but uses the "special" equilibration process for selected lambda windows, useful for when some simulations keep failing
rbfe_simulate.py: Creates input scripts and runs shell scripts to perform MD
convergence_test.py: Helper script for rbfe_simulate.py, contains methods for post-processing of dV/dl data
